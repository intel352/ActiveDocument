# ActiveDocument: Document ORM for Yii #
ActiveDocument is an ORM for Yii, providing Active Record functionality for document-based storage engines.
This library is functionally similar to Yii's own SQL-based Active Record class, CActiveRecord.

## Current Storage Drivers ##
* Memory - temporary storage using PHP memory. Good for nested documents, and testing.
* Riak - via the Yii ext, Riiak (currently packaged in with ActiveDocument)

## Planned Storage Drivers ##
* MongoDB
* CouchDB
* Redis
* SQL - may possibly add support for SQL, if only as a CActiveRecord wrapper (to enable seamlessly changing storage driver)

## Requirements ##
* Yii 1.1+ (Yii 1.1.7+ recommended, lower releases should be compatible, but are untested)
* PHP 5.3+ (ActiveDocument library is namespaced, which is a PHP 5.3 feature)

## Installation ##
Clone this repository to your protected/extensions/ directory, to use the latest available code

    hg clone https://bitbucket.org/intel352/activedocument

## Quick start ##
This quick example uses the Memory driver

        // ...

    /**
     * NOTE 1:
     * An important difference in ActiveDocument from CActiveRecord, is that you are no longer required to specify a
     * model() method within every model class that you create. ActiveDocument makes use of a PHP 5.3 feature, Late
     * Static Binding, to achieve the same purpose as CActiveRecord::model() with less redundancy.
     *
     * NOTE 2:
     * In CActiveRecord, table fields/columns are detected and made available as magic properties, which are
     * listed in the phpdoc for any model generated by Gii.
     * Since Document engines typically do not store a schema for your data, you would normally have to specify
     * every attribute as an actual class property, or via the attributeNames method.
     *
     * To reduce redundancy, a feature has been built into ActiveDocument's MetaData class, which will parse
     * your phpdoc to determine what attributes are available for a model, as well as the var type (to be used for
     * default attribute validation rules).
     *
     * @property string $name
     * @property array[]ConfigSetting $options Not needed for ActiveDocument, this exists as helper phpdoc for IDE users

                 * ActiveDocument instead requires 2 values (type, model). A foreign key is no longer needed, as related
                 * documents have their primary key stored into the parent document.

                 * If you specify the named parameter, 'nested', as true, the related document[s] will have copies

                 * to the 'options' relation, a copy of each would be stored within the Config instance in the data
                 * engine.
